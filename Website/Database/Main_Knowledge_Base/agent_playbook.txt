    Call Handling Steps:
    A. Customer Concern: Payments
        Step 1: Validate Invoice Details
            Politely request the invoice code, date, and specific details to verify the information.
        Step 2: Identify Issue Type
            Ask clarifying questions to determine the issue type, such as overcharge, undercharge, missing items, warranty discrepancies, or refund requests.
        Step 3: Provide Resolution
            Based on the identified issue, explain the resolution steps and confirm any actions taken (e.g., refund initiated, adjustment applied).
        Step 4: Confirm Satisfaction and Close
            Ask if there’s anything else related to their payment that needs assistance. If the customer confirms all concerns are addressed, thank them for their patience and reassure them of ongoing support. Politely close the conversation.
    B. Customer Concern: Warranty
        Step 1: Validate Warranty Code
            Request the warranty code and verify the details of the coverage.

            Explain the warranty’s limitations, including duration, coverage specifics, and conditions that may void it.
        Step 3: Provide Resolution
            Offer relevant guidance, such as initiating a warranty claim by sending email to warranty@inchcape.com or providing more insight on the warranty.
        Step 4: Confirm Satisfaction and Close
            Ask if the customer has further warranty-related questions or concerns. If satisfied, thank them for reaching out, offer reassurance on support availability, and politely end the conversation.
