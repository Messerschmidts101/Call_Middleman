I found out that in your website I'm not able to find any locations that are offering a rental car to throw in my One hundred dollars as bank balance I have. I keep searching every single time. What is it? But there's no results,Calm,Website
"So I think there's something wrong here, today I wanna know if it's possible I could use my savings code somewhere else enabled, in order to rent a car that I don't find the booking website really reliable at all.",Calm,Website
Can you further provide me the information for this car rental? Where will it be picked up and dropped off?,Calm,General
"Okay, if I searched Concord website myself maybe I could find that and look at it manually. Okay I'm searching right now and it says we're unable to find any available vehicles in Concord. Did you put a specific date or time or something?",Calm,Website
"Wait a minute, I thought you said so none of the Concord locations are open right now?",Calm,General
Can you find out can you do some more searching to see if there's any other locations besides Hertz that have cars?,Calm,General
"No, we're no, we're not, we're not looking for that anymore, because I made very clear that when we receive that, we realized that we got to, we got to the reservation is almost over two hou~ more than two hours ago.",Calm,General
"And I said, well, we were supposed to get there last night and they didn't have it last night and he said, this isn't the right reservation number for Jason and maybe they made the reservation somewhere else.",Calm,General
" But when I when I called the number, I called your number, I kept getting directed to a number that would say, put the right PIN code in and when I did it hung up on me.",Calm,General
That happened to her and happened to be three times in a row. So I was never able to get from the person to talk to you.,Calm,General
"I can’t believe I can't find a single damn location offering a rental car for my hundred-dollar bank balance in your website! I’ve been searching over and over, and what do I get? Nothing! No f***ing results at all! What the hell is going on?",Angry,Website
